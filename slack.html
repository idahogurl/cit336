        <h1>Collaboration</h1>

        Collaboration - the ability to work together to accomplish a task, goal
        or outcome - is a skill that is consistently mentioned by employers as a
        requirement for new and seasoned employees. In this course you will be
        requried to work with others on a weekly basis using both the discussion
        board and team meetings. Each individual is responsible for her or his
        own work, but interacting, supporting, assisting and collaborating are
        desirable and required in this class.
        <h2>Work Team</h2>

        During week 2 you will organize yourselves into teams of 3 or 4. In an
        online environment it is strongly suggested that you work with others in
        or near your own timezone whenever possible. The team will become your
        primary source for feedback and help. You are required to meet together
        each week to discuss the content of the week, assessments, insights and
        help one another with these things. These team meetings will be arranged
        for a location (face-to-face, Skype, Google Hangouts, etc...) and time
        that is acceptable to those in the team. Your attendance at and
        participation in the weekly meeting will be graded.

        <h2>Slack</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          We will NOT be using the discussion boards. Instead, we will be using
          Slack. I'm on Slack all day and I prefer that you contact me over
          Slack instead of email. My inbox gets too cluttered and often incoming
          email gets accidently marked as junk. You will find you'll get help
          much faster from me and your classmates using Slack instead. To join
          our workspace, click
          <a
            href="https://join.slack.com/t/cit-336-section-5/shared_invite/enQtNjEyNjY5NDY4MDA0LWZiOTNiYTc4NWRiMWZlNzlkMWYyZTc3OTE1MTkyZWRlNjFhMTk2OWVmOTZiMzFiNjc3OGNiNTFjODc2OWI5ZTU"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week you are required to complete a report. One question asks
          about your discussion board participation. As long as you participated
          (2 or more posts) on Slack in the #general or #tech-learning channel,
          then you can count that as discussion board participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip</strong>: Install the iOS or Android version on your
            smartphone in addition to the desktop versions. You'll find it far
            easier to earn your participation points by being more connected.
