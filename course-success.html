        <h3>Class Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          I want to start you off on the right foot. With the following
          information, I hope you will have a clear understanding of what to
          expect and what it takes to succeed in this class. I don't want to
          scare anyone off, but I want you all to honestly evaluate if you meet
          the expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find programming courses are NOT your typical 3 credit
          classes. There is lots of material to cover and only 14 weeks to do
          so. You must expect to put in at least 9-15 hours per week. Please
          take a moment and consider your future in this course.
        </p>
        <p>As the syllabus states:</p>
        <p>
          You must be self-motivated to succeed in this course. There are
          expectations of constant learning and application &mdash; be anxiously
          engaged! Previous students have commented that you can do well in this
          course only if you stay caught up and work to grasp the concepts and
          apply them. Take their advice!
        </p>
        <p>
          Practice what you learn! Pull up your editor and try out things.
          Experiment! I put a link to a PHP sandbox below where you can try out
          PHP code.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting Help</h3>
        <p>
          It is NOT a matter of IF, rather WHEN you will need help. Act quickly
          when you need help. When you start struggling, even the tiniest bit,
          go get help! Do NOT put it off! There are several resources to get
          help:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prayer</li>
          <li>Classmates</li>
          <li>
            Schedule an online tutor. Click online tutor to the left to schedule
            a tutoring session. DO NOT underestimate how much just one tutoring
            session will help you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Internet &amp; Programming Books: You MUST learn how use the
            Internet and books as a resource. It is part of being a programmer!
            I am constantly looking up resources, and reading API and reference
            material while working. There are a MASSIVE number of programming
            sites, books, and documentation for PHP. Your textbook is not a
            comprehensive PHP guide.

            I am available via e-mail and Slack all day. I prefer Slack to
            email. Usually get a response immediately with Slack. I am also
            available by appointment. You can sign up for an available time slot
            by going to
