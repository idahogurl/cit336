        <h1>Deployment</h1>
        <p>
          By now you are wondering how to get your files to our web host. This
          process is called deployment. The most common deployment method is the
          usage of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). What's FTP? Watch the video
          below.
        </p>

        <p>
          So to use FTP you need an FTP client. Using an FTP client is
          relatively straight forward. You enter the URL of the FTP server and
          your account username and password. Once connected, you select the
          files you want to upload or copy to the web host.
        </p>

        <p>
          The downside to using an FTP client is that you manually have to
          upload your web site with your changes. It becomes tedious to upload
          every little change when you already have to push your changes to
          GitLab. That's when Continuous Deployment comes into play.
        </p>

        <h1>Continuous Deployment</h1>
        <p>
          What if every time you push to master that your web site is updated as
          well. Look no further than to Continuous Deployment (CD). Continuous
          deployment is an automated process to deploy your web site changes.
          GitLab and many other git providers have started providing Continuous
          Deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
          To implement Continuous Deployment, you need a script file. A script
          file contains an ordered set of commands to tell GitLab how to deploy
          your changes. You should already have this file (.gitlab-ci.yml) inside your repository.
        </p>
        <h3>Environment Variables</h3>
        <p>
          Environment variables are a dependency of the script file in your repository. Here is a
          short video to teach you about environment variables.

        <h4>Environment Variables in GitLab</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Within GitLab, click Settings &gt; CI/CD in the left sidebar.</li>
          <li>To the right, expand "Environment variables".</li>
          <li>You will see a few variables are already created for you by your instructor.</li>
          <li><strong style="color: red; text-transform: uppercase;">Please refrain from changing any of these variables or else you will break your web site.</strong></li>
