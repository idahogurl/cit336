            <h1>Deployment</h1>
            <p>
                By now you are wondering how to get your files to our web host. This
                process is called deployment. There are several methods to send files to
                a remote server with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and SSH (Secure Shell) being
                most common.
            </p>
            <h2>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)<h2>

            <h2>SSH (Secure Shell)</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z7jVOenqFYk?start=0&end=100" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
                The downside to using an FTP client or SSH client is that you manually have to
                upload your web site with your changes. It becomes tedious to upload
                every little change when you already have to push your changes to
                GitLab. That's when Continuous Deployment comes into play.
            </p>
            <h1>Continuous Deployment</h1>
            <p>
                What if every time you committed or merged that your web site was updated with the
                changes? Look no further than to Continuous Deployment (CD). GitLab provides built-in
                Continuous Deployment. Continuous deployment is an automated process to deploy your web site changes. Your repository has been setup for is already setup to deploy each time a commit is pushed to "master."
            </p>
            <p>
                To implement Continuous Deployment, you need a script file. This script
                file contains an ordered set of commands to tell GitLab how to deploy your changes.
                You should already have this file (.gitlab-ci.yml) inside your repository.
            </p>
            <h2>Environment Variables</h2>
            <p>
                Environment variables are a dependency of the script file in your repository. Here is a
                short video to teach you about environment variables.
            </p>

            <h3>Environment Variables in GitLab</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Within GitLab, open your "acme" project.</li>
                <li>Click Settings &gt; CI/CD in the left sidebar.</li>
                <li>To the right, expand "Environment variables".</li>
                <li>You will see a variable already created for you by your instructor.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong style="color: red; text-transform: uppercase;">
                Please refrain from changing anything here or else
                you will break your web site.
