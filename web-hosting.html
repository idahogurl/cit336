       <h1>Web Hosting</h1>
       <p>
         To allow your instructor to easily grade your assignments you will a
         web host (remote server). What is a web host you may ask. The video
         below will give a quick overview to answer this question.

         There are lots of web hosts out there especially for PHP. You will
         be provided a web host for this course. You will not need direct access
         to add files or administrate MySQL.

      <h1>Remote Database</h1>
        <h2>Shared Hosting</h2>
        <p>
          Typically when a hosting account is purchased from a hosting company,
          that account is in a shared environment. This means that the account
          resides on a server with other accounts - this the server is "shared".
          While this is cost effective, it also poses a few challenges. One of
          those challenges is creating and using databases that belong to your
          account and not to someone else.
        </p>

        <h2>Databases in the Control Interface</h2>
        <p>
          In a shared hosting environment, it is important to realize that you
          are restricted from running SQL scripts to create a database and
          provide rights for users to the database. Instead, you must use the
          hosting company's database creation tool, which usually includes a
          means of creating proxy users and granting rights or privileges to
          those users for a particular database.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this course, your remote database has already been created for you
          as well as a proxy user to access your database.
          You don't need to do the setup work that you did for your local database server.
          Your remote database has been setup in a way that you will not need to do any modifications
          the entire semester.
        </p>
        <h2>Modify connection.php</h2>
        <p>
          To have PHP connect to your remote database, we will need to
          make some changes to the connection file.
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your connection.php file</li>
          <li>
            From the code below, copy the IF statement below the function
            acmeConnect. <br />*Note: Make sure to include the curly brace.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the code above your local connection variables in
            connection.php with exception of $server.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then copy the ELSE statement and place it below your local
            connection variable. <br />*Note: Make sure to include the curly
            braces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter the values indicated by the comments to the right.
          </li>
        </ol>
