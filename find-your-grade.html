        <h2>Find Your Grade</h2>
        <p>
          This video will show you where to find your scores in iLearn as well
          as how to calculate your current letter grade. Most of the video is
          applicable to our class except for the place to find feedback. We will
          be using GitLab to submit your assignments using Merge Requests. You
          will not submit anything in iLearn with the exception of the weekly
          report.

        <h2>Find Your Feedback</h2>
        Once your instructor reviews your code, you should receive an email
        notification that your merge request was either merged or closed.

        <p>To find your feedback, you need to open your merge request.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open your "acme" project in GitLab</li>
          <li>Locate the sidebar on the left and click "Merge Requests".</li>
          <li>In the right panel, the Merge Requests screen will show.</li>
          <li>Click "All" and then locate your merge request.</li>
          <li>Click on the merge request's name to open it.</li>
          <li>
            Once the merge request loads, you will be located in the
            "Discussion" tab where you'll find comments about your code. <br />
            <strong>
              NOTE: When a comment is below a line of code, the comment is
              always only about the line above unless line numbers are
              referenced.
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking on the file name will take you to the file in the "Changes"
            tab. The "Changes" tab shows all the files you changed and the diffs
            of what was added and removed. Added content is green and removed
            content is red.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This video will get you more aquainted with merge requests.</p>
