        <h1>Enhancement 1</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This enhancement is a review of the concepts, skills and techniques
          that should have been learned in CIT 230 - Web Frontend Development.
          It requires you to build a template and home page from that template
          for a ficticous web site - Acme, Inc.
        </p>

        <h2>Notice!</h2>
        <p>
          All html and css must be of your own creation. No outside templates or
          frameworks are acceptable for this enhancement or future enhancements
          in the course.
        </p>

        <h3>Video Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This video provides a brief demonstration of what your finished
          enhancement should look like and how it should behave once done with
          the enhancement.
        </p>

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          This enhancement assumes that you can code semantic and valid HTML5,
          CSS3 (including the use of media queries and responsive layouts) and
          implement the basic design principles of Proximity, Alignment,
          Repetition and Contrast. In addition, basic usability concepts can be
          implemented readily. The review materials listed in the overview page
          are meant to help brush up with these skills as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Prerequisite</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure you cloned your GitLab repository to your local "htdocs"
          folder. All subsequent work with the Acme web site will be performed
          there.
        </p>

        <h2>Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Create a <a href="submit-your-work.html#branches">Branch</a></h3>
        <h3>Build a Template</h3>
        <p>
          You are to build a generic template for the Acme web site (a template
          contains no content, it is a resource from which actual content pages,
          known as views, can be built). See the illustration below:<br />
          <img
            src="../images/acme/template.jpg"
            alt="An image of the acme template"
          />
        </p>

        <p>The template must:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>use the .php file extension,</li>
          <li>
            use HTML5 semantic structures (header, nav, main and footer) for
            page sectioning,
          </li>
          <li>include the viewport meta element,</li>
          <li>
            include the <b>media="screen"</b> attribute for the css link
            element,
          </li>
          <li>
            use the color scheme shown:
            <img
              src="../images/acme/acme-colors.jpeg"
              alt="Acme color swatches"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            use fonts of your choice, but they should fit the cartoon look and
            feel,
          </li>
          <li>
            be fully responsive to a variety of devices so that the content
            loads without horizontal scrolling or zooming (see the video
            illustration below),
          </li>
          <li>
            use usability concepts, the minimum expectations are:
            <ul>
              <li>links contain title attributes</li>
              <li>images contain alt attributes</li>
              <li>
                fonts are easily read and contain clear contrast between
                background and foreground colors
              </li>
              <li>
                headings form a meaningful document outline with no levels being
                missed
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            use external CSS for all styling. The CSS must:
            <ul>
              <li>be stored in the provided css folder,</li>
              <li>start with a mobile first approach,</li>
              <li>
                be responsive to varying screen sizes of a variety of devices,
              </li>
              <li>
                use media queries for responsive layout only for larger screen
                sizes,
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            use modularization for common content (e.g. page header, navigation
            and footer) by:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Creating a "<b>common</b>" folder to store the common content
                code snippets (modules).
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a separate code snippet for the acme header, navigation
                and footer and store each into the "<b>common</b>" folder.
              </li>
              <li>
                Follow the directions in the "<b>Modularizing Common Content</b
                >" activity to implement the modules into the template.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be sure to thoroughly test that the code from the code snippet
                modules get delivered to the template file, and later to the
                actual web pages (views) that you build using the template.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>weigh less than 400Kb total weight, and</li>
          <li>be valid HTML5 and CSS3 code.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Build the Acme Home View</h3>
        <p>
          Having built the template, you will now use it to build the Acme home
          view. The view must:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            be named "home.php" and be stored at the root of the
            <b>acme</b> folder,
          </li>
          <li>
            contain the content as shown in the images below (a text file with
            the text content is included in the download) and images are found
            in the images folder,
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/acme/acme-home-page.jpg"
                alt="Picture of the Acme home page for large screen"
                style="border: 1px solid #000;"
              />
              <figcaption><i>Acme home - Large Screen</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
              <img
                style="max-width: 320px;"
                src="../images/acme/acme_home_mobile.jpg"
                alt="Picture of the Acme home page for mobile screen"
                style="border: 1px solid #000;"
              />
              <figcaption><i>Acme home - Mobile Screen</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            Write your CSS to position the page content to match as closely as
            possible the provided images of the home.php view in both large
            screen and mobile screen layouts.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build and test your code in the local development environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work with your learning team to accomplish the task and post to and
            read the weekly discussion board to help one another.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check your work to ensure that it meets all of the expectations
            listed.
          </li>
          <li>
            When satisfied that the code is operational:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a short video of the template AND home page. Include in
                the video:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    both the template and home page as they appear in the
                    browser.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    a demonstration of the responsiveness of the home view in a
                    browser.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    a demonstration of the validity of the HTML5 and CSS3 of the
                    home view in the browser.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                post your video to your YouTube channel and copy the link to the
                video when published.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a
                <a href="submit-your-work.html#merge" target="_self"
                  >merge request</a
                >. Paste the link to your video in the description input when
                creating your merge request.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
        <p>
          Use the grading items below to pre-grade your work as these are the
          exact grading items the professor will use to grade the work.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both files (template and home) use the php extension:
            <b>2 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The home view uses modularization for common content:
            <b>3 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The home view uses semantic structures (header, nav, main, footer):
            <b>3 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>The home view is valid HTML5: <b>4 points</b></li>
          <li>
            The home view is responsive across devices with no zooming or
            horizontal scrolling required to view content (including images):
            <b>4 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            All CSS is external (no internal or inline CSS is found):
            <b>2 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The content headings in the home page form a meaningful outline with
            no skipped levels: <b>2 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The usability standards mentioned above are found in the home page:
            <b>4 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Both the template and home page are fully operational with no broken
            text, links, images or other content: <b>4 points</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The video of the finished project is present and shows both view,
            responsiveness and validity as required: <b>2 points</b>
          </li>

          <li>Total value: <b>30 points</b> - all in objective 1</li>
        </ul>
