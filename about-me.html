          Hello and welcome! My name is Rebecca Vest, and I will be your
          instructor For CIT 336 this semester. Iâ€™ve taught CIT 336 a bunch of times
          now as well as CIT 160. Teaching programming is not for the faint of
          heart.

          I am an eastern Idaho native. I grew up and have lived here all my
          life. My husband Barry is an eastern Idaho native too. We have been
          married for 15 years. We met online, and after many emails, we found
          out we lived a few blocks away. Talk about a small world! We decided
          to meet each other at a restaurant in town, and four months later we
          were engaged for four more months.

          Barry is a partner in a family-owned landscape nursery. It's a bit
          south of Idaho Falls. We have two kiddos. Owen is 11 1/2 and Emma is 6
          1/2. Both came to our family as newborns through the miracle of
          adoption.

          We live at the end of city limits in a small city named Rigby. We have
          the best of both city and country life that way. It is 20 minutes
          south from BYU-I and 20 minutes north of Idaho Falls (which is the
          biggest city near us).

          Professionally, I have been in the software engineering world for over
          15 years. That does make me feel old. I know a whole gamut of
          programming languages and technologies. If you are interested, check
          out my LinkedIn profile.

          Believe it or not, back in 2004, I was one of the first graduates of
          the Information Systems program at BYU-I. Straight out of college, I
          started working for a company called PolicyTech in Rexburg that
          produced policy management software. It was bought out and became part
          of a compliance solutions company called NAVEX.

          After ten years, I decided it was time for a new project. For a year,
          I worked for a company called Curricunet that produces curriculum
          management software for colleges and universities. I left to work for
          Stukent and helped a team of junior developers finish an e-Textbook
          reader using React and Node.js. Now I am working for Healthline using
          React and Node.js. Healthline is a health, nutrition, &amp; wellness
          website similar to WebMD.

          I love programming and all things related. They better have computers in
          heaven. I love helping others learn, and helping them find their career path, 
          even when they find they are not suited for programming. I am a big believer that the
          gospel can play a role in programming. There have been countless times
          where I have prayed for inspiration and help in solving a programming
          problem. The Holy Ghost is a gift that I believe so many of us
          under-utilize, so use it!
