        <h1>Git Version Control</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          We will be using Git version control to submit assignments. You will
          make a branch of your master repository, commit to that branch, and
          then create a merge request for me to review. If this sounds Greek to
          you, don't worry, I will cover this in video tutorials. Those who had
          CIT 230 may already be familiar with Git version control.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will still be required to submit your assignment. Instead of a ZIP
          file of your code, you will provide a document or text file with the
          link to your video recording. The submission date of that file will be
          used to determine whether the assignment was late.
        </p>
