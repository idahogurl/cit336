        <h1>Late Work Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Work is due as specified by the course calendar and indicated in the
          weekly overview pages and assessment descriptions. Typically
          assessments are due Saturday evenings at 11pm Mountain Time
          (America/Boise time zone).
        </p>
        <h2>What is late?</h2>
        <p>Work is considered late when not submitted:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>on time, or</li>
          <li>in an incomplete form, or</li>
          <li>submitting the wrong assessment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Grace Period</h2>
        <p>
          You have up to 4 days to turn in a late assignment for full credit,
          after which you will receive 50% credit. Work that is late may be
          submitted through the Saturday prior to the final project being due.
          The grace period applies to the coding assignments only and not the
          weekly reports, teaching presentations, and final project.
        </p>
        <h2>Test</h2>
        <p>
          Be sure to check links to videos for operability and that the correct
          assessment was submitted to the correct location. It is your
          responsibility to make sure things are correct.
