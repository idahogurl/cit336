        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          We will be using Git to submit assignments using
          <a href="#branches" title="Jump to branches section">branches</a> and
          <a href="#merge" title="Jump to merge requests section"
            >merge requests</a
          >. You will not submit anything in iLearn with the exception of the
          weekly report and the discussion board.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use Git, we have GitLab hosting our repositories. GitLab,
          Bitbucket, GitHub are the most well known Git hosts. Git is a version
          control system. For those unfamiliar with Git, here is a video that
          gives a high-level explanation.

          So, Git provides:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>the ability for multiple individuals to work on the same code</li>
          <li>
            a timeline of saves called commits, where each has a description and
            date
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="branches">Branching</h2>
        <p>
          The way Git implements the first functionality is through the use of
          branches. When a repository is created, a branch called "master" is
          automatically created. From "master", individuals create new branches.
          Sometimes branches are discarded, but usually, the branch gets merged
          into "master" by the
          <a href="#merge" title="Jump to merge requests">merge request</a>
          approver once approved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you cannot merge because of competing changes (your changes
          vs. another person's changes to the same file) that Git cannot resolve
          without help. Since you are the only developer working on your code
          this should rarely happen. If it does happen, please contact your
          instructor for help. Resolving merge conflicts is beyond the scope of
          this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you start an enhancement, you must create a branch as outlined
          in the video and steps below. As you work, you will commit your
          changes to that branch. will not be merging your branch into "master"
          as described above. Instead, you will just repeat the branch creation
          steps. That is not typically the procedure developers follow. With 25
          merge requests to review, I can't finish them fast enough.
        </p>

        <h3>Create a Branch in VS Code</h3>
        <h4>Video Demonstration</h4>
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"

          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Within VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or
            âŒ˜+Shift+P on Mac).
          </li>
          <li>
            Once opened, type
            <strong>Git: Create Branch</strong> and press
            <strong>Enter</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            When asked for a branch name, use this format:
            enhancement-[enhancement #], i.e., Enhancement 1 would be
            enhancement-1.
          </li>
          <li>Open the Command Palette again.</li>
          <li>
            Once opened, type
            <strong>Git: Publish Branch</strong> and press
            <strong>Enter</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Open the "acme" project in GitLab</li>
          <li>
            Click Repository > Branches in the left sidebar and ensure your
            branch it is listed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="merge">Merge Requests</h2>
        <p>
          A Merge Request is merely a request to merge your branch of code
          changes into another branch; usually, this will be the "master"
          branch. GitHub uses the term "Pull Request" instead, but their purpose
          is the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merge requests give the ability for another individual to review and
          discuss the proposed changes. You will have your code changes reviewed
          by me, and then I will merge your branch into the "master" branch. The
          creation date of the merge request serves as your assignment
          submission date. If your merge request is created after the due date
          then it is late.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not wait for your merge request to be merged into "master" for you
          to start the next assignment. Just create a new branch after you
          create the merge request, and you are ready to go. At the end of the
          semester, you should have 11 branches since we won't be deleting
          branches after merge.
        </p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Before you start, you should have already created a branch and
            pushed your changes to GitLab.
          </li>
          <li>Open your browser and go to your "acme" project inside GitLab</li>
          <li>Click Repository > Branches in the left sidebar.</li>
          <li>Find your branch and click the white "Merge request" button.</li>
          <li>Remove "WIP:" from your merge request title.</li>
          <li>
            Enter the url of your video recording in the description area.
          </li>
          <li>Click on the "Approvers" textbox and type in Rebecca Vest.</li>
          <li>Click on my name in the search results.</li>
          <li>Click on the "Submit merge request" button.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>
            For every enhancement, you will follow the branch and merge request
            steps. You will create a branch that you will commit to as you work.
            When you've finished committing all your changes then create a merge
            request to submit it.
