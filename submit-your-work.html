      <h1>Starting Your Work</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          We will be using Git to submit assignments using
          <a href="#branches" title="Jump to branches section">branches</a> and
          <a href="#merge" title="Jump to merge requests section">merge requests</a>. 
          You will not submit anything in iLearn with the exception of the weekly report.
      </p>
      <p>
          To use Git, we have GitLab hosting our repositories. GitLab,
          Bitbucket, GitHub are the most well known Git hosts. Git is a version
          control system. For those unfamiliar with Git, here is a video that
          gives a high-level explanation.
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <p>So, Git provides:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>the ability for multiple individuals to work on the same code</li>
          <li>
              a timeline of saves called commits, where each has a description and
              date
          </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="branches">Branching</h2>
      <p>
          The way Git implements the first functionality is through the use of
          branches. When a repository is created, a branch called "master" is
          automatically created. From "master", individuals create new branches.
          Sometimes branches are discarded, but usually, the branch gets merged
          into "master" by the
          <a href="#merge" title="Jump to merge requests">merge request</a>
          approver once approved.
      </p>
      <p>
          Sometimes you cannot merge because of competing changes (your changes
          vs. another person's changes to the same file) that Git cannot resolve
          without help. This is called a merge conflict. Since you are the only developer working on your code
          this should rarely happen. If it does happen, please contact your
          instructor for help. Resolving merge conflicts is beyond the scope of
          this course.
      </p>
      <p>
          Before you start an enhancement, you must create a branch as outlined
          in the video and steps below. As you work, you will commit your
          changes to that branch.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you want to learn more about branching and merging, you can read
          this
          <a href="https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/" target="_blank" title="Open article for reading">article</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Create a Branch in VS Code</h3>
      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>
              Within VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or
              âŒ˜+Shift+P on Mac).
          </li>
          <li>
              Once opened, type <strong>Git: Create Branch</strong> and press
              <strong>Enter</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
              When asked for a branch name, use this format:
              enhancement-[enhancement #], i.e., Enhancement 1 would be
              enhancement-1.
          </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Committing and Pushing Changes</h2>
      <p>
        As you work, you should make periodic commits. A commit is when your file changes are saved
        to your local repository. Unlike saving to your computer, you do not need to commit for every little change. Commit when you have a portion of work done. "Add stylesheet for homepage" or "Fix hero image for tablet" are good examples of commit messages. Remember a commit is local until you "push" it to your Git host.</p>
      <p>
        This video demostrates how to commit and push changes, but do not actually complete the steps on your computer.
        <strong style="text-transform: uppercase; color: red;">
          In other words, do not commit anything at this point.
        </strong>

        <h1>Submitting Your Work</h1>
        <h2 id="merge">Merge Requests</h2>
        <p>
          A Merge Request is merely a request to merge your branch of code
          changes into another branch; usually, this will be the "master"
          branch. GitHub calls them a "Pull Request."
        </p>
        <p>
          Merge requests give the ability for another individual to review and
          discuss the proposed changes. You will have your code changes reviewed
          by your instructor, who will then merge your branch into the "master" branch. The
          creation date of the merge request serves as your assignment
          submission date. If your merge request is created after the due date
          then it is late.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must have your commits pushed before you create your merge request. Unless the merge request is locked, you don't have to create a new merge request if you need to add changes prior to the due date. Since commits are dated your instructor will know if you try to sneak in changes before its graded.
      </p>
        <p>
          Do not wait for your merge request to be merged into "master" for you
          to start the next assignment. Just create a new branch from the branch
          of your last enhancement, and you are ready to go. At the end of the
          semester, you should have 11 branches since we won't be deleting
          branches after merge.
        </p>
        <h3>Create Merge Request</h3>
        <h4>Video Demonstration</h4>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OlYdlKWIKJg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
              Before you start, you should have already created a branch and
              pushed your changes to GitLab.
          </li>
          <li>Open your browser and go to your "acme" project inside GitLab</li>
          <li>Click Repository &gt; Branches in the left sidebar.</li>
          <li>Find your branch and click the white "Merge request" button.</li>
          <li>Remove "WIP:" from your merge request title.</li>
          <li>
              Enter the url of your video recording in the description area.
          </li>
          <li>Click on the "Assignee" dropdown and click on my name.</li>
          <li>Click on the "Submit merge request" button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>
                For every enhancement, you will follow the branch and merge request
                steps. You will create a branch that you will commit to as you work.
                When you've finished committing all your changes then create a merge
                request to submit it.
            </strong>
