                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    We will be using Git to submit assignments. You will still be required to submit your assignment. Instead of a ZIP file
                    of your code, you will provide your video URL within a document or text file. The submission date of
                    that file will be used to determine whether the assignment was late.
                    
                    To use Git, we have GitLab hosting our repositories. GitLab, Bitbucket,
                    GitHub are the most well known Git hosts. Git is a version control system.
                    For those unfamiliar with Git, here is a video that gives a high-level explanation.

                <p>
                    So, Git provides:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>multiple individuals with the ability to work on the same code</li>
                    <li>a timeline of saves called commits, where each has a description and date</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Branching</h2>
                <p>
                    The way Git implements both functionalities is through the use of
                    branches. When a repository is created, a branch called "master" is
                    also created. From "master", individuals create new branches.
                    Sometimes branches are discarded, but usually, the branch changes get
                    merged into the master branch. Merge conflicts do arise, but that is a
                    topic for another day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will create a branch for every assignment. Instead of having you
                    merge into and branch from "master," you will branch from the previous assignment's branch. 
                    That is not typically the procedure developers follow. 
                    With 25 <a href="#merge" title="Jump to merge requests">merge requests</a> to review, I can't review them fast enough for you start 
                    the next assignment from "master". If you want to learn more about branching and merging, you can

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Within VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or
                        âŒ˜+Shift+P on Mac).</li>
                    <li>
                        Once opened, type
                        <strong>Git: Create Branch</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When asked for a branch name, use this format:
                        enhancement-[enhancement #], i.e., Enhancement 1 would be
                        enhancement-1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Open the Command Palette again.</li>
                    <li>
                        Once opened, type
                        <strong>Git: Publish Branch</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Open the "acme" project in GitLab</li>
                    <li>
                        Click Repository > Branches in the left sidebar and ensure your
                        branch it is listed.
                    </li>
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <h2 id="merge">Merge Requests</h2>
                <p>
                    A Merge Request is merely a request to merge your branch of code
                    changes into another branch; usually, this will be the master branch.
                    GitHub uses the term Pull Request instead, but are essentially the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Merge requests within GitLab have many features available. We are only
                    concerned about the ability to review and discuss the proposed
                    changes. You will have your code changes reviewed by me, and then I will close
                    the merge request. Usually, I'd merge your changes into "master" before closing it
                    but since we are branching from the previous assignment there is no need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: You do not have to wait for your merge request to be reviewed
                    for you to start the next assignment. Just create a new branch after
                    you create the merge request, and you are ready to go. At the end of
                    the semester, you are welcome to merge your final project's branch
                    into "master."
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Before you start, you should have already created a branch and
                        pushed your changes to GitLab.
                    </li>
                    <li>Open your browser and go to your "acme" project inside GitLab</li>
                    <li>Click Repository > Branches in the left sidebar.</li>
                    <li>Find your branch and click the white "Merge request" button.</li>
                    <li>Remove "WIP:" from your merge request title.</li>
                    <li>Enter a description.</li>
                    <li>Click on the "Approvers" textbox and type in Rebecca Vest.</li>
                    <li>Click on my name in the search results.</li>
